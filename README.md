# cs50-s-Mario-pyramid-problem-set
A simple project to recreate the blocks of pyramid from the Super Mario Brother's game. Here we shall be using # to represent the bricks in our C program.

The program accepts height inputs within the range [1,8], where 1 & 8 are inclusive. After this, the program prints a pyramid shape pattern
of the entered height similar to the image displayed below but in non-graphical context.

Voila  :)
